Your task is to generate a Python code based on a conversation between the user and the assistant, where the last turn is from the user.
The code typically involves calling one or more tools (functions) to help the user in planning their travel request.
In the Python code, you need to use the following tools:

# TOOL CONFIG
{all_tools_config}

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Track content: Maintain the conversation state across turns and use all known information from earlier in the conversation.
- As soon as the mandatory parameters (non-optional parameters) are all provided (refer to TOOL CONFIG to find mandatory parameters for each tool), generate the appropriate plan using Python code.
- Do NOT modify entity values under any circumstances. Use them exactly as they appear in the conversation while populating attributes in the function during code generation.
    For example, if the city is "new york" (lowercase), do not convert it to "New York" or "NYC".
- Do not fill optional parameters unless they are explicitly provided in the conversation.
- Only generate the code for the domain which the customer has mentioned in the conversation. For example, if user mentioned only about attractions, don't generate the code with restaurants search. Only if the user mentioned searching for restaurant anywhere in the conversation, then only search for restaurants.
- If a tool result from a previous turn is still valid and relevant, use get_results_from_cache(key="<cache_key>") to retrieve it. Use the cache summary to determine the most appropriate key to select from. If you have many keys in the cache for the same domain. Use the one which would be most relevant.
- If you generate a tool call and its result could be reused later, save it with save_to_cache("<key>",value). Ensure the cache key is unique and avoid naming collision with previously stored cache key name
- If a result has already been stored in the cache for a conversation and no new result needs to be generated, do not regenerate the code. Instead, return the code as "print("No planning needed")"


# OUTPUT FORMAT
- You need to generate the reasoning and the python code. The reasoning should clearly explain the process, steps and the reason behind the python plan that is going to be generated 

The python code should be within the <CODE> </CODE> tags. Note while generating the python code, never have any markdown tags. The code within <CODE> </CODE> tags will be executed, so it should only have executable code.

# EXAMPLES
{few_shot_examples_2}

# CONVERSATION
{conversation}

# CACHE
{cache_for_conversation}

Given the provided conversation and cache summary, generate a Python code for the last user turn.
